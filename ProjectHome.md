# Introduction #
BTK is an open-source and cross-platform library for biomechanical analysis. BTK read and write [acquisition files](FileFormatSupported.md) and can modify them. All these operations can be done by the use of the C++ API or by the wrappers included (Matlab, Octave, and Python).

The core of BTK is primary based on a pipeline design and on shared pointers. Each process can be linked (the output of previous is the input of the next) and scheduled together. The use of shared pointers permits to avoid the need of memory allocation/deletion, the choice of object's owner and the possibilities of memory leaks. Since BTK 0.1.7, the binary files (C3D, TRB, ANB, RIC, etc) use the [memory-mapped file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file)![http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif](http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif) mechanism to be read and written faster (2x and more).

# Changelog #
The list of changes in the releases of BTK is available [here](Changelog.md)

# Support #
If you have any question or you think you found a bug, you can send an email to the [BTK Users](http://groups.google.com/group/btk-users)![http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif](http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif) group. You can also tweet [@btkwww](http://twitter.com/btkwww)![http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif](http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif) for any informations.

# Download #
The latest packaged sources are for [BTK Core 0.3](https://code.google.com/p/b-tk/downloads/detail?name=btk-core-0.3.0_src.zip).

## Mokka software ##
The latest binaries for Mokka are available on the [mini-website](http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/mokka/index.html)![http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif](http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif) by clicking on the button _Download Now_. These binaries are available for MacOS 10.7+ (64-bit) and for Windows (32/64-bit).

## Python binding ##

The latest packages for the Python binding are accessible on the page PythonBinaries.

## Matlab binding ##

The latest packages for the Matlab binding are accessible on the page MatlabBinaries.

# Documentation #
The documentation presented below is also centralized in this [page](SummaryDocumentation.md). You will find also the official [logos](SummaryDocumentation#Logo.md) used by BTK and Mokka and also some informations to [cite](SummaryDocumentation#Publication.md) the project Biomechanical ToolKit in your papers.

## Build instructions ##

The BTK sources include a `Readme.html` which details the configuration, compilation and install steps.

## C++ API ##

The API documentation for the latest release can be found [here](http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/doc/API/0.3/index.html)![http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif](http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif). It includes also tutorials to integrate BTK in your project.

## Python ##

The binding is proposed into a package named `btk`. Even if you can find the binding documentation by using the command `help(btk)`, there is also an online documentation [here](http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/doc/Python/0.3/index.html)![http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif](http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif). It includes, tutorials, FAQ and a description for each function.

You can download the latest binaries for Python by using the informations in the PythonBinaries page.

## Matlab/Octave ##

Each binding is packaged into a toolbox named `btk`. Even if you can find the binding documentation by using the command `help btk`, there is also an online documentation [here](http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/doc/Matlab/0.3/index.html)![http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif](http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif). It includes, tutorials, FAQ and a description for each function.

You can download the latest binaries for Matlab by using the informations in the MatlabBinaries page.

Detailed instructions to build Octave are available in the wiki page OctaveBuildInstructions.

### C3DServer emulation ###
The program C3Dserver gives access to the content of a C3D file and is able modify it under Windows 32-bit in programs such as Matlab, Labview or Excel. However, with the development of the computers' architecture (32-bit vs 64-bit) and the variety of the operating systems (Windows, MacOS X, Linux), several users cannot use anymore C3DServer.

To resolve this problem under Matlab/Octave, a M-Script file was written to emulate C3Dserver using the BTK functions. All the informations to see how to use it as well as benchmarks are in the wiki page [C3DServerEmulationForMatlab](C3DServerEmulationForMatlab.md).

## Mokka ##

Mokka (MOtion Kinematics & Kinetics Analyzer) is a standalone cross platform software which uses heavily BTK. Started only as a demo software to show the possibilities to display markers' data in a 3D environment, it is today a valuable tool to explore biomechanical data (markers, forceplates, EMGs, video, etc).

Mokka has a [mini-website](http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/mokka/index.html)![http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif](http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif) to show its main features and to download the latest release. There is also a [UserVoice](http://mokka.uservoice.com/forums/158152-mokka)![http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif](http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif) page where you can add and vote for the next features to implement! The help integrated into Mokka is also available online (using the screenshot for MacOS X). You can find the documentation for the latest relase of Mokka [here](http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/doc/Mokka/0.6/index.html)![http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif](http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/images/external-link.gif).

### Roadmap ###

You can check the [roadmap](MokkaRoadmap.md) for the next releases of Mokka. If you would like some specific features or improvement, please contact us.
